(function () {
  console.log(1);
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(2);
  }, 1000);
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(3);

// Output: 1 4 3 2

// Explanation: The code is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that logs 1, 4, 3, and 2 to the console. Let's go through the code step by step: 1) The first console.log(1) logs 1 to the console. 2) The first setTimeout is called with a delay of 1000 milliseconds. This means that the callback function will be executed after 1000 milliseconds. 3) The second setTimeout is called with a delay of 0 milliseconds. This means that the callback function will be executed as soon as possible. 4) The console.log(4) logs 4 to the console. 5) The callback function of the second setTimeout is executed and logs 3 to the console. 6) The callback function of the first setTimeout is executed and logs 2 to the console.
